        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To help cater and provide an overall wonderful experience to those who are serving in the temploe or visiting
            for religious purposes.
            The Temple Inn & Suites helps you to feel the Spirit even when you come back from your temple worship,
            wedding, or youth trip.
            We believe you should be able feel that same Spirit you feel at home, church, or temple here in our hotel.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> Those members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who are visiting the temple
            will love our free Family history Consultation, the kids will enjoy our pools,
            and even those on a work trip trying to stay close to House of the Lord can get their free fast reliable
            WIFI for all their work needs.
            All those that would like to feel closer to their Heavenly Father even if not a member of our faith,
            as long as they are willing to abide by certain guidelines.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Roboto Bold 700</h4>
        <p>I think for something like this website it should be a clean classic style font, I also want it to be a
            little bolded as it is the heading.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto 300</h4>
        <p>I don't think changing the font family is necessary from the header to the paragraph but the difference in
            the bold I think adds enough of a difference.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
