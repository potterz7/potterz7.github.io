        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This will be a side business tghat just focuses on regulkation sized, customizable cornhole boards.
            This website is to increase interest in cornhole and provide an easy simple way to buy cornhole boards
            and bags for themselves or for gifts to others.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> The audience will be first for College kids and tailgating events. I will include some advertising for families as well.
            This is a protable game board that I believe college kids and tailgaters would use most. The next group would be familes 
            going to the beach or on a picnic, since this is a game for all ages.

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Roboto Bold 700</h4>
        <p>I think for something like this website it should be a clean classic style font, I also want it to be a
            little bolded as it is the heading.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto 300</h4>
        <p>I don't think changing the font family is necessary from the header to the paragraph but the difference in
            the bold I think adds enough of a difference.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
