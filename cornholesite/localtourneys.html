                <h2>History of the Atlanta Temple</h2>
                <p>The Atlanta Georgia Temple was the first temple dedicated by President Gordon B. Hinckley, 
                    who went on to dedicate or rededicate 89 other temples. At the dedication of the Atlanta Georgia Temple, 
                    President Hinckley promised that the baptistry would one day be enlarged. That promise was fulfilled 14 years later 
                    when a renovation project enlarged the baptistry, added offices, and remodeled the waiting rooms. 
                    President Hinckley himself returned to the temple to dedicate the baptistry addition.</p>
